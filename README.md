Project Title: The Healthcare Staffing Problem
 
Problem:
The problem we are trying to solve is healthcare staffing distribution. 
Motivation:
This is a growing problem for hospitals that are short staffed and need to quickly allocate nurses to the highest priority positions. 
The healthcare system can be overwhelmed in areas with a high demand. More efficient workload balancing would keep this from happening. 
Hospitals can incur unnecessary expenses due to overstaffing and decreased quality of care due to understaffing.
Features: When do we know that we have solved the problem?
We will know that we have solved the problem when all high priority positions are filled followed by lower priority positions. 
Data: (public data set we will be using and the link to the public data) or (schema of randomly penetrated data â€“ i.e. what are the different columns in our dataset and the respective data types)
The data we will be inputting into our program will be randomly generated names and locations, as well as a randomly generated list of positions in hospitals ranked by priority. 
There will also be an unchanging data set of hospitals.
Tools: Programming languages or any tools/frameworks we will be using
C++
Visuals: Wireframes/sketches of the interface or the menu driven program

Strategy: preliminary algorithms or data structures you may want to implement and how would you represent the data
Heaps
Weighted graph
Distribution of Responsibility: who is responsible for what?
Mackenna: allocation of data as well as meeting planning
Kyle: creation of hospital information to be made into data structures
Christopher: creation of layout for basis plan
